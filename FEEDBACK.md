Hi Ingrid,



Congratulations on submitting your assignment! You completed a financial analysis project for MercadoLibre, Latin America's largest e-commerce platform with over 200 million users. The analysis focuses on exploring relationships between Google search traffic patterns, stock price movements, and forecasting future trends using Prophet. Through detailed data examination, the analysis revealed interesting patterns, including increased search traffic during MercadoLibre's financial results release in May 2020 and a correlation between search trends and stock price movements during the first half of 2020, particularly showing aligned spikes in both metrics between March-April and May-June.



Your analysis also uncovered several temporal patterns in search traffic: peak activity occurs at midnight (00:00), Tuesdays see the highest search volume during the week, and the lowest search traffic point occurs in mid-October. Using Prophet for time series forecasting, the model predicted a slight decline in popularity for October 2020, dropping approximately 10 points. The study demonstrated a weak negative correlation (-0.15) between lagged search traffic and stock volatility, suggesting that when search traffic increases, there's a slight tendency for stock volatility to decrease, though this relationship is not strong enough to be considered predictive. Great work Ingrid!
